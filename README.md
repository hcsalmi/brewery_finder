# 🍺 Brewery Search Android App

This is a brewery search Android application built using **Qt Quick**, **QML**, and **C++**.

The app uses the [Open Brewery DB API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/), a free public dataset that provides information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops.

📱 This project was my first experience with both mobile development and the Qt/QML framework. I designed the app to be modular and easy to expand with new features — such as displaying brewery locations on a map or adding advanced search options (e.g. by brewery type or country). While the current version focuses on Ireland, the app is structured to support additional countries with minimal effort.

🛠️ The app was developed using Qt 6.8.2, C++, and QML, and tested on both an Android emulator and a physical device (Pixel 9). Qt Creator version used is 15.0.1.

🔍 Currently, the app includes functionality to find:

- the brewery with the longest name in Ireland
- the northernmost and southernmost breweries in Ireland
